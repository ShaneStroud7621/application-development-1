# Week 3 Node.js Assignment

## What I built
I created a simple Node.js program in `week03/` that prints an identification header, runtime information, environment configuration, and a JSON-formatted `appConfig` object.

## How to run
From the repository root:

```
cd week03
npm start
npm run dev
```

## Resources used
- Node.js process docs: https://nodejs.org/api/process.html
- npm scripts docs: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts
- AI assistance: GitHub Copilot (GPT-5.2-Codex) in VS Code. Chat transcript is available in the local VS Code Copilot chat history; export or attach it if your instructor requires a link.

## Concept questions
- **What `package.json` does:** It defines the project metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts used to run tasks like `npm start`.
- **What `process.env` is:** It is the Node.js object that exposes environment variables provided by the operating system or shell.
- **What `npm start` runs:** It runs the `start` script defined in `package.json` (here, `node index.js`).
- **Bugs or errors encountered:** None during setup and execution.

# Week 04 Reflection

## Reflection Questions

1. **What was the original bug?**  
   The original bug involved an unexpected crash of the application when users tried to submit their input. After investigating, it became clear that the issue stemmed from a null reference that was not being handled properly within the input validation logic.

2. **What are the benefits of logging?**  
   Logging provides a clear trail of events leading up to an error, which aids in diagnosing issues swiftly. It allows developers to track the application's behavior over time, monitor performance, and understand user interactions, which is essential for maintaining and improving the application.

3. **What are the advantages of testing?**  
   Testing helps ensure that the application behaves as expected, reduces the likelihood of bugs making it to production, and provides confidence in code changes. Automated tests can catch regressions and facilitate continuous integration, ultimately improving software quality.

4. **Which test should be kept?**  
   I believe the integration tests should be kept. They evaluate whether different components of the application interact as expected and are critical for ensuring that the system functions correctly as a whole, especially after changes are made to underlying code.

## Conclusion  
These reflections highlight the importance of identifying bugs, the role of logging in providing context, and the necessity of rigorous testing practices to maintain a robust application.

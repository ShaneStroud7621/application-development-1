# Git Notes

## Local vs Remote
- Working locally feels safer to me because I can mess around, test stuff, and fix mistakes without anyone seeing it until I'm ready.
- Remote (GitHub) is clutch for backups and sharing, but I usually double-check everything before pushing because once it's up there, it's public (or at least visible to others).

## Repo, Commit, Branch
- A repo is just where the whole project is stored, like the main folder for everything.
- A commit is saving your progress—like a permanent snapshot of your files at that exact moment.
- A branch lets you work on stuff without breaking the main project.
- **I think of a branch like a "multiverse" where I can try a crazy idea without ruining the version of the code that actually works.**

## Staging Area
- The staging area is where you pick what changes you actually want to save.
- It lets you review stuff before committing so you don't accidentally save something broken.
- Basically a middle step between editing your code and locking it in.

## Push vs Pull
- Push sends your local changes up to GitHub.
- Pull brings updates from GitHub down to your computer.
- I think of it as push = upload, pull = download.

## .gitignore
- .gitignore tells Git what files to not track.
- You usually ignore things like system files, temp files, or stuff with passwords.
- It keeps the repo clean and avoids pushing things that don't matter.

## README.md
- The README explains what the project is about and how to use it.
- It's the first thing people see, so it helps them understand the project fast.
- A good README makes your project look way more organized.
